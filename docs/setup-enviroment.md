## Setup SDK

This UI kit is written in Flutter so you will need Flutter SDK to run this application.

Below are steps to install Flutter SDK based on your OS.

- [MacOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos)
- [Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux)
- [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)
- [ChromeOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/chromeos)

After installing Flutter, You need to install Android SDK or iOS SDK.

## Setup an Editor

You will need an IDE to use Flutter more efficiently. Of course you can use Android studio from previous section.

We suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) But you can use any other IDE which supports Flutter.

Flutter website has a list of supported IDEs and instructions are available [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio).

After installing VSCode, Install flutter plugins.

Then you will be able to run the UI Kit immediately (Run application)[]
